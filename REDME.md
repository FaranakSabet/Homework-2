#HomeWork-2
Responsive Portfolio


I'd like to admit that my biggest issues in all my homeworks including this project were usually stupis typos and simple things like forgeting a colon or semicolon and as a result having an error message that most of them is not clear for me! 

So in this folder I have 3 pages which each of them has their own css and html files separately(portfolio, contact and about me). I know it is better to have just one css file for all of them but for now as a person new to this subject, it is way easier for me to keep track on my work when each page has its own css sheet.

Today I moved the navigation tabs on my portfolio page fron right to left so it looks lik my other two pages(contact and about me).

In addition I addd the icon for social networking and linked them to my social networking web pages.
